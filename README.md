# ART+COM Recruiting Profiles & Templates

Use this repository to write recruiting profiles in a collaborative and sustainable manner for developers.

## Campaign oriented directory Structure

Recruiting is structured in campaigns. The recruiting campaignes are reflected in the directory structure. Every campaign lives in a subfolder of its own. A recruiting text which was used once in a concrete campaign stays available in its original form. Older campaigns are moved to the [_archive](_archive) subfolder.

Using branches for this would be technically possible but it makes comparing and evolving recruiting texts much harder as you would have to diff over branches instead of campaign folders. Keep in mind this repository should be accessible by office people/non-developers without deeper knowledge of git branching.
